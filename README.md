# Hamilton Pressure Washing — Simple Static Site

Files added:

- `index.html` — main landing page with hero, services, reviews, process, contact, FAQ, footer
- `styles.css` — site styles using brand colors
- `script.js` — accordion, smooth-scroll and simple form stub

Quick preview:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. Replace placeholder phone number +1-905-555-0199 with your real number.
3. Replace `images/hero.jpg` and `images/service-left.jpg` with real photos.

Next steps (suggested):

- Connect form to a real endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your server).
- Add real Google Business link in the reviews section.
- Optimize images and add alt text variations for SEO.
